> This package is currently work in progress.

confi**go**ration *(yeah, it's no typo)* is another configuration interface library which provides a similar API to the [Configuration Extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.configuration?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1) of .NET Platform Extensions 3.1 providing a [`ConfigurationBuilder`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.configuration.configurationbuilder?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1) like builder struct which produces a Section instance which is inspired by the [`IConfiguration`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.configuration.iconfiguration?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1) interface of .NET.
